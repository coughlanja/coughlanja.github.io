    "text": "Access via publisher\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective\nOral health (OH) of refugees is under-researched and most publications are from developed countries despite the majority of refugees hosted in low-middle income countries. Most of the Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh have no access to dental care. The objective of this study was to report on the OH behaviours and utilisation of an emergency dental service in the camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study utilised the data from clinical records of Rohingya refugees attending an emergency dental clinic in camp four in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh from February 2019 to March 2020. Data included education levels, OH practices, tobacco consumption, diagnosis and treatment provided. Descriptive analysis of the data was undertaken.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 4111 patients were included, of which 50.1% were female. Education levels were very low, with 75.8% reporting no formal education. Although daily toothbrushing was reported by 64.4%, there was significant variation in the materials used for a dentifrice, with 78.1% using abrasive substances. Tobacco use was high, with 65.7% reporting its use, and of those, 95.4% chewed paan. Pain was the commonly reported symptom (87.1%) and nearly half, 46.9%, reported poor OH. Functional difficulties and problems sleeping were highly prevalent, at 85.3% and 51.6% respectively. A high prevalence of caries was reported, at 79.8%, and a mean number of 2.8 teeth affected. Extraction and temporary restorations were the common treatment modalities, at 52.1% and 23.1% respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh have low education levels, unhealthy oral health practices, high consumption of tobacco and a high prevalence of oral disease. Further research is required to inform the design and delivery of community-based oral health intervention strategies suitable for refugee camps to improve oral health literacy, knowledge and practices."

    "text": "Access via publisher\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction\nEvidence concerning the interactions between human health and planetary health has grown extensively in recent years. In turn, the perceived importance of environmental sustainability within higher education is growing at a rapid rate. This paper provides a summary of key elements as they apply to dentistry, and provides an introduction to the reader of an early consensus of how sustainability could be included as part of the dental curriculum.\n\n\nMethods\nThe consensus opinion within this paper largely centres around discussion at the ADEE sustainability workshop at the annual conference in Berlin (August 2019). In order to help inform discussions at the workshop, a brief scoping questionnaire was circulated to potential participants regarding their understanding and current teaching practices in sustainability. An infographic was designed to help delegates remember the important elements of sustainable dentistry. Delegates discussed the concept of sustainability alongside the infographic, and how they could link these with the Graduating European Dentist (GED) curriculum.\n\n\nResults\nThe discussions within the workshop largely centred around 4 main themes: Disease prevention and health promotion, Patient education and empowerment, Lean service delivery and Preferential use of strategies with lower environmental impact.\n\n\nDiscussion\nIt is apparent that there is a widespread need for teaching materials relating to environmental sustainability; this includes specific learning outcomes relating to the 4 educational domains of the Graduating European Dentist curriculum, and methods for teaching and assessing these outcomes.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis paper reports consensus on the first phase of a pan-European working group on Sustainability in dental education."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Access via publisher\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction\nCOVID-19 pandemic impacted dental students and postgraduate residents world-wide, forcing them to rapidly adapt to new forms of teaching and learning. Dental school leaderships needed to ensure the academic continuity, therefore the majority of the in-person actives were transitioned into a virtual setting. The aim of this study was to identify students’ perception regarding the measures taken to adapt during the pandemic by different dental schools in the European Region.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis cross-sectional study utilised a validated 37 questions survey. Ethical approval was obtained from the Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. Using this instrument, the perceptions of the European dental students regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their education and mental health were identified. The questions were divided into categories: standard demographic information; models of education during the COVID-19 pandemic (types of teaching, examination and other educational activities) and support received. The survey was administered through electronic online tools, and all responses remained confidential. The data were processed through quantitative and qualitative analysis.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 879 student responses to the survey from 34 countries in the European Region were included in this study. When asked about the time spent on their education, 50% of the participants (n = 435) reported spending less time on their education and 30% (n = 265) reported spending more time. The types of teaching included showed a heterogeneous approach, varying from online simulations to problem solving for the didactic setting, or a hybrid model with group activities for the clinical setting. There were broad splits in satisfaction with the education delivered, with 44% (n = 382) being either satisfied or very satisfied and 31% (n = 279) being either unsatisfied or very unsatisfied. Students were most concerned with their clinical experience and skills.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe qualitative and quantitative data compiled in this cross-sectional study enable a direct comparison between different approaches to adapt dental education during the COVID-19 in the European Region. Future studies are recommended that will include compiling perceptions from the staff, faculty and administrators on the transition as well."

    "text": "Access via publisher\n\nAbstract\nThis chapter explores the role of system transformation in the drive towards sustainability. This chapter presents this broad vision of sustainability in dentistry by coupling sustainability with dentistry’s social contract, or the mutual commitments and reciprocal obligations that dentistry shares with society by virtue of being a regulated health profession. Healthcare systems need to be more focussed on efficient, appropriate treatment (based on evidence) to not only become more efficient but also to reduce their overall environmental impact. A number of system characteristics need to be considered from an environmental, fiscal, and social perspective. The chapter views the lens of six building blocks for health systems strengthening; service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership/governance.\nSustainability isn’t about reducing your environmental emissions; it needs a system reconstruct; and all of these building blocks are pivotal in building a sustainable dental system."

Brexit will impact many sectors of the economy, including the dental sector.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\nThis policy analysis evaluates UK and EU legislation and planning documents, as well as the published literature, to analyse the impact of two scenarios relating to the UK’s exit from the EU on the dental sector: a free trade agreement based on the jointly agreed Political Declaration (the ‘FTA’) and a ‘no-deal’ scenario.\n\n\nConclusion\nAn FTA could cause price increases of medicines and medical devices, and cause some disruption to the ability of regulating authorities in this area, while a no-deal would additionally risk shortages of medicines and medical devices as well as more dramatic price increases. In both an FTA and a ‘no-deal scenario’, with EU law no longer applicable to the UK, more innovative policy in the area of tobacco control could be developed. An FTA could exacerbate existing workforce shortages and would likely cause a reduction in EU research funding, as well as posing issues with data transfers, with these all likely to be more severe under a no-deal scenario."

We use a synthetic control method to compare research expenditure in the United Kingdom before and after Brexit to artificial controls comprising EU countries and regions. Our findings suggest that Brexit had little effect in the short-term, and we argue a substantial increase in research expenditure from 2020 onwards was driven by investments in the pharmaceutical and medical device sector in response to COVID-19 rather than Brexit. We also find geographic heterogeneity, with regions containing prestigious universities and research centres such as London and East England most resilient to the shock.\n\n\nCatalan\nAquest article utilitza el referèndum sobre el Brexit del 2016 com a experiment natural per examinar els efectes d’unes barreres comercials més estrictes en la inversió en recerca i desenvolupament (R+D). Utilitzem un mètode de control sintètic per comparar la despesa en R+D al Regne Unit abans i després del Brexit amb un control artificial construït a partir de països i regions de la UE. Els resultats suggereixen que el Brexit no ha tingut un impacte significatiu a curt termini. S’observa un increment important en la inversió en recerca a partir del 2020, atribuïble més a la indústria mèdica i farmacèutica a causa de la pandèmia que no pas al Brexit. A més, trobem que aquelles regions amb universitats i centres de recerca prestigiosos mostren una major resiliència davant el xoc."

    "title": "Research as a general dentist – an exciting career path",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This blog was first published on the NIHR School for Primary Care Website\n\nDental research is a small field, and for many dentists may conjure up images of specialists researching niche topics, or scientists developing novel dental materials in a lab. Yet most dental care is provided in primary care, in “high street” dental practices up and down the country, where the challenges and solutions of providing high quality care are a far cry from large teaching hospitals and sterile laboratories.\nUntil recently, dental research has generally done a poor job of reflecting this, but thankfully there is now a growing interest in carrying out research about and in primary dental care settings and nurturing academic general dentists who can translate their knowledge and experience into relevant, impactful research.\n\nGetting Started in Research as a GDP\nDespite many people getting involved in research at dental school, there is often the perception that research is only something you do as part of a specialty programme, and if you decide not to follow this route then there are no other opportunities. There are now a range of programmes to help get interested general dentists involved in research, such as the Pre-Doctoral Fellowships, Academic Clinical Fellowships in Primary Dental Care, and the NIHR Associate PI scheme. With protected research time, structured research training, project guidance and a clinical salary, these programmes allow academic GDPs to focus on developing their research skills alongside their clinical practice, without worrying about lost income and lack of time. The diagram below shows some of the options depending on your career stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, I was privileged have been awarded a SPCR Primary Care Clinicians Career Development Fellowship focussing on the health economics of primary dental care at the University of Manchester, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research School for Primary Care Research (NIHR SPCR). This meant that half of my time each week was spent being a practicing GDP in London, and the other half was spent carrying out research. My project investigated how dental charges impact patients financially, and whether they led to catastrophic health expenditure, which is where people spend a large proportion of their available income on healthcare expenditure. The fellowship also gave me the time and budget to take training courses in health economics research methods, to present my work at academic conferences and to develop a strong application for a funded PhD programme, which I have just started in October 2024.\nMy fellowship was based in the Health Organisation, Policy and Economics (HOPE) group at The University of Manchester, largely because of their expertise in the health economics of primary medical care, while my other and collaborative research culture. I learnt so much from listening to weekly presentations from those carrying out health economic research in general medical practice, which helped me to hone my own dental research ideas, and so many people, both senior academics and early career researchers, generously offered time and feedback on my work and PhD plans.\nThere are other indirect benefits, especially on work-life balance and job satisfaction - unlike the hectic, highly structured days in practice, your research time is almost entirely decided on by you. You can choose how to distribute your time between training and research, or whether to work from home on some days. Having time to enjoy my morning coffee while reading interesting papers is definitely a treat I very much look forward to!\n\n\nOkay, I’m interested, so what now?\nIf you’ve got this far, I might have persuaded you to consider a career in academic primary dental care. So, how do you get into these fellowships and programmes?\nMany of these opportunities are awarded through competitive applications, which means you’ll need to work on an application. These are judged on four main criteria: why you are the right person, why the project is important, why your university and supervisors are the right people to oversee your fellowship, and how your training plan can give you the skills to succeed. Often you will need to write about your previous research experience and output, plan a small research project, propose training and development plan and explain why you want to pursue a career in academic primary dental care.\nThis is the stage that many get tripped at. You need to be specific about why your research is important to primary dental care, and how it will be carried out. Your potential supervisors can help you with this, but you need to spend time thinking through the details – how will you get access to data, what methods will you use and how the project might lead to a PhD. Many applications now require public and patient involvement (PPI) too. Your project doesn’t need to be perfect, but the more you have thought this through, the greater your chance of success. As well as your supervisors, you can also use the NIHR Research Support Service to help.\nYou’ll also need to decide where to apply through. Unlike speciality training applications, with Pre-Docs you apply with a university and a supervisor. Take some time to research potential supervisors - these are the people that will help you navigate the (initially opaque) waters of academia and research. Ideally you want supervisors you work well with and who have some knowledge of either your topic area or the methods you will use. These don’t always have to be people you know; I had never met Matt, one of my supervisors, and simply emailed him asking about the fellowship and proposing my project.\nFinally, these applications can take some time, so make sure you plan well in advance. Applications for Pre-Docs open around Christmas each year, with deadlines around March. It’s never too early to begin thinking about topic areas, reading relevant papers and reaching out to potential supervisors. For those who are thinking of applying – just do it! There is so much important research still to be done in primary dental care, and every interesting care, every clinical problem you encounter, every workaround is a potential avenue for valuable research.\nNow feels a good time to shout out my amazing supervisors Matt (Sutton, Professor of Health Economics) and Wendy (Thompson, Senior Lecturer in Primary Dental Care) who made my experience at Manchester so hugely rewarding and enjoyable. There are too many other people to thank, but special thanks to Kath Checkland, Rita Chow, Igor Francetic, the whole HOPE team, NIHR SPCR for supporting my research and the numerous people who have kindly given me advice and support. I’m really excited to be back at HOPE to start my PhD.\nIf anyone has questions or wants more information, you can reach me at james.coughlan@manchester.ac.uk."
