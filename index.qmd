### About Me

I am a health economist and dentist currently undertaking [NIHR School for Primary Care Research](https://www.spcr.nihr.ac.uk/career-development/doctoral-training-programme-for-primary-care-clinicians) funded Doctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester.

My doctoral research examines the impact of financial incentives in NHS dentistry, both on the supply-side and demand-side. This includes studies investigating the impact of the NHS General Dental Services contract, dental charges for patients and the role of the private sector in healthcare systems.

More broadly, my research interests centre around health financing and policy, global oral health and causal econometrics. I am also developing blogs and tools on how to access dental data and analyse these in R/R Studio.
